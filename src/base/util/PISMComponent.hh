  \section pism_components PISM's model components and their interface

  We've found that many sub-models in PISM share some tasks: they need to be
  "initialized", "updated", asked for diagnostic quantities, asked to write the
  model state...

  Component and its derived classes were created to have a common interface
  for PISM sub-models, such as surface, atmosphere, ocean and bed deformation
  models.

  \subsection pismcomponent_init Initialization

  Component::init() should contain all the initialization code,
  excluding memory-allocation. (We might need to "re-initialize" a
  component.)

  Many PISM sub-models read data from the same file the rest of PISM reads
  from. Component::find_pism_input() checks options `-i` and `-bootstrap`
  options to simplify finding this file.

  \subsection pismcomponent_output Writing to an output file

  A PISM component needs to implement the following I/O methods:

  - add_vars_to_output_impl(), which adds variable names to the list of fields that need
  to be written.
  - define_variables_impl(), which defines variables to be written and writes variable metadata.
  - write_variables_impl(), which writes data itself.
  
  Why are all these methods needed? In PISM we separate defining and writing
  NetCDF variables because defining all the NetCDF variables before writing
  data is a lot faster than defining a variable, writing it, defining the
  second variable, etc. (See <a
  href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf/Parts-of-a-NetCDF-Classic-File.html#Parts-of-a-NetCDF-Classic-File">The
  NetCDF Users' Guide</a> for a technical explanation.)

  Within IceModel the following steps are done to write 2D and 3D fields to an
  output file:

  - Assemble the list of variables to be written (see
  IceModel::set_output_size()); calls add_vars_to_output()
  - Create a NetCDF file
  - Define all the variables in the file (see IceModel::write_variables());
  calls define_variables()
  - Write all the variables to the file (same method); calls write_variables().

  \subsection pismcomponent_timestep Restricting time-steps

  Implement Component_TS::max_timestep() to affect PISM's adaptive time-stepping mechanism.

   * Defines the common interface of time-stepping components.
   *
   * Derived classes should use this method to perform computations
   * needed to step from `t` to `t + dt`. This could be
   * a no-op.
   *
   * Time-step length `dt` should never be zero.
   *
   * This method will be called only once with a given `t`, `dt` pair;
   * the value of `t` in a particular call should be equal to `t + dt`
   * in the previous call (i.e. there should be no "gaps" or "repeats").
   *
   * One unfortunate exception is the initialization stage:
   * IceModel::bootstrapFromFile() and IceModel::model_state_setup()
   * may need to "know" the state of the model at the beginning of
   * the run, which might require a non-trivial computation and so
   * requires an update() call. Because of this *currently* update()
   * may get called twice at the beginning of the run.
   *
   * Other interface methods
   * (SurfaceModel::ice_surface_temperature() is an example)
   * should use cached values if the corresponding computation is
   * expensive. Methods like
   * SurfaceModel::ice_surface_temperature() might be called
   * multiple times per time-step.
   *
   * TemperatureIndex is an example of a component that does a
   * fairly expensive computation in TemperatureIndex::update() and
   * uses cached values in
   * TemperatureIndex::ice_surface_mass_flux_impl().
   *
   * *Who* calls this depends on the kind of the component in
   * question, but all calls originate from IceModel::step() and the
   * initialization methods mentioned above.
