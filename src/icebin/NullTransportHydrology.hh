//! The PISM minimal model has till in a "can".  Water that overflows the can is not conserved.  There is no model for lateral transport.
/*!
This is the minimum functional derived class.  It updates till water thickness.

It has no transportable water and subglacial_water_thickness() returns zero.

This model can give no meaningful report on conservation errors.

Here is a talk which illustrates the "till-can" metaphor:
